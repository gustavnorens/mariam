# Mariam is a functional programming language

# TODO
- Add sugar for lists and tuples
- Add more advanced pattern matching and perhaps letrec
- Add chars and subsequently strings
- Use the perceus algorithm for improved reference counting.
- Implement a polymorphic type system
- Add a tracing collector for benchmarks / learning.
- Optimize closures and functions (fully applied functions or (partial applications) should not be compiled as curried closures etc)
- Add join / jump points.
- Generally implement other optimizations
