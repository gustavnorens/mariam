# Mariam is a functional programming language

# TODO
- Add branching with jump and join points.
- Add a tracing collector and reference counting
- Optimize closures and functions (fully applied functions or (partial applications) should not be compiled as curried closures etc)
- Add more advanced pattern matching and perhaps letrec
- Add chars and subsequently strings
- Implement a polymorphic type system
- Generally implement other optimizations
